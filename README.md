# Google Cloud Platform Condor Pool Manager (GCPM)

HTCondor pool manager for Google Cloud Platform.

## Installation

### Package installation

GCPM can be installed by `pip`:

    $ pip install gcpm

### Service file installation

To install as service, do:

    $ gcpm install

:warning: Service installation is valid only for the system managed by **Systemd**.

If **logrotate** is installed, logrotation definition for **/var/log/gcpm.log** is also installed.

## Configuration file

### Configuration file path

The default configuration file is **~/.config/gcpm/gcpm.yml**.

For service, the configuration file is **/etc/gcpm.yml**.

To change the configuration file, use `--config` option:

    $ gcpm run --config /path/to/my/gcpm.yml

Note:

* Primary accounts

If primary accounts are set, jobs of **non-primary** accounts can run on test worker nodes.

If there are already max number of 1 core worker nodes
and idle jobs of non-primary accounts are there,
test worker node named **&lt;prefix&gt;-test-1core-XXXX** will be launched
and only non-primary account jobs can run on it.

This able to run such a test job w/o waiting for finishing any normal jobs.

Such test worker nodes can be launched until total cores are smaller than `max_core`.

To use this function effectively, set total of `max` of each core to less than `max_core`.

e.g.)

```yml
---
machines:
  core: 1
  max: 10
machines:
  core: 8
  max:  2
max_core: 20
primary_accounts:
  - condor_primary
```

In this case, normal jobs can launch 10 1-core machines and 2 8-core machines,
then 16 cores are used.

Even if there are a log of idle **condor_primary**'s jobs,
1 core test jobs by other accounts can run: 4 jobs at most.
